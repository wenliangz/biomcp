# BioMCP Technical Overview

## System Shape

BioMCP is a single Rust binary (`biomcp`) with two operating modes:

- **CLI mode:** Standard command-line invocation. Each command is a blocking
  async call that prints markdown to stdout and exits.
- **MCP server mode:** `biomcp serve` starts a JSON-RPC MCP server over stdio.
  Agents connect through the MCP protocol and call tools that mirror the CLI
  command surface.
- **HTTP mode:** `biomcp serve-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080` starts the
  Streamable HTTP server. Remote MCP traffic uses `/mcp`, and lightweight
  probes live at `/health`, `/readyz`, and `/`. This is the canonical scaling
  answer when rate limiting needs to be shared across concurrent agent workers,
  since rate limiting is otherwise process-local.

The binary is also distributed as `biomcp-cli` on PyPI (a thin Python wrapper
that ships the platform-specific Rust binary). Python is packaging only;
no Python logic is involved in query processing.

## Build and Packaging

```
cargo build --release --locked   # Rust binary
uv build / uv publish            # PyPI wheel (biomcp-cli)
curl ... install.sh | bash       # binary installer (resolves latest release)
```

- **Edition:** Rust 2024
- **Current version:** see `Cargo.toml` (`scripts/check-version-sync.sh` keeps
  `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `manifest.json`, and
  `CITATION.cff` aligned)
- **Package name:** `biomcp-cli` on PyPI; binary name is `biomcp`
- **PyPI publishing:** GitHub Actions trusted publisher (no token needed)
- **Release checklist:** Bump `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `manifest.json`, and `CITATION.cff`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, verify version
  sync, then cut a GitHub release tag — the release workflow builds and
  publishes

## Source Integration Patterns

BioMCP integrates with 15+ upstream APIs. Integration patterns:

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| REST JSON | UniProt, ChEMBL, InterPro, ClinicalTrials.gov, cBioPortal, OncoKB, OpenFDA |
| GraphQL | gnomAD, OpenTargets, CIViC, DGIdb |
| Custom REST JSON | MyGene.info, MyVariant.info, MyChem.info, PubMed/PubTator3, Reactome, g:Profiler |
| Flat-file / XML REST | KEGG (plain-text flat-file / TSV-like responses), HPA (XML) |

All queries are read-only. BioMCP never writes to upstream systems.
Shared HTTP-client reuse is preferred but not universal: source modules may
reuse the shared middleware client or use a source-specific request path when
timeout, retry, caching, request-construction, or transport needs differ.
These transport differences are architectural, not implementation accidents.

Federated queries (e.g., `search all`, unified article search) fan out in
parallel across sources and merge results. Federated totals are approximate
due to cross-source deduplication — `total=None` is the correct design for
federated counts.

See also: [Source integration architecture](source-integration.md) for the
detailed contract for adding a new upstream source or deepening an existing
integration.

## Article Federation and Front-Door Validation

`search article --source all` plans PubTator3 plus Europe PMC. Semantic
Scholar is an optional third search leg on that path when the filter set is
compatible. Strict Europe PMC-only filters such as `--open-access` and
`--type` disable the federated planner and route to Europe PMC only.
`--source pubtator` with strict Europe PMC-only filters is rejected at the
front door. `--source` remains `all|pubtator|europepmc` in v1; the CLI does
not expose a user-facing `--source semanticscholar` mode.

After fetch, article results deduplicate across PMID, PMCID, and DOI where
possible, then re-rank locally.

The validation boundary is also part of the architecture contract:

- `search article` rejects missing filters, invalid date values, inverted date
  ranges, and unsupported `--type` values before backend calls.
- `get article` accepts PMID, PMCID, and DOI only and rejects unsupported
  identifiers such as publisher PIIs with a clean `InvalidArgument`.
- Semantic Scholar helper commands accept PMID, PMCID, DOI, arXiv, and
  Semantic Scholar paper IDs and reject other identifiers before calling the
  backend.

## Chart Rendering

Chart rendering belongs to the local study analytics surface, not the generic
entity lookup path. The architecture has two related chart surfaces that share
the same chart vocabulary but serve different purposes.

- `biomcp chart` serves embedded markdown chart docs through
  `src/cli/chart.rs`, `docs/charts/`, and `RustEmbed`.
- `biomcp chart` documents the chart surface, but does not render charts.
- `biomcp study ... --chart` is the rendering path, with `ChartArgs` defined
  in `src/cli/mod.rs` and output generation implemented in
  `src/render/chart.rs`.

The rendering entrypoints are `study query`, `study co-occurrence`,
`study compare`, and `study survival`. Across those commands, BioMCP supports
`bar`, `stacked-bar`, `pie`, `waterfall`, `heatmap`, `histogram`, `density`,
`box`, `violin`, `ridgeline`, `scatter`, and `survival`, with the command and
data-shape matrix enforced in code:

| Command | Valid chart types |
|---------|-------------------|
| `study query --type mutations` | `bar`, `pie`, `waterfall` |
| `study query --type cna` | `bar`, `pie` |
| `study query --type expression` | `histogram`, `density` |
| `study co-occurrence` | `bar`, `pie`, `heatmap` |
| `study compare --type expression` | `box`, `violin`, `ridgeline`, `scatter` |
| `study compare --type mutations` | `bar`, `stacked-bar` |
| `study survival` | `bar`, `survival` |

The renderer targets terminal, SVG file, PNG file behind the `charts-png`
feature, and MCP inline SVG output. `--cols` and `--rows` size terminal
output. `--width` and `--height` size SVG, PNG, and MCP inline SVG output.
`--scale` is PNG-only. `--title`, `--theme`, and `--palette` style rendered
charts. Heatmaps reject `--palette` because `study co-occurrence --chart
heatmap` uses a fixed continuous colormap.

MCP chart responses are handled by `rewrite_mcp_chart_args()`, which turns a
charted study request into a text pass plus an SVG pass. In that rewrite
boundary, `--terminal` is stripped, `--output` / `-o` are rejected, and
`--cols` / `--rows` and `--scale` are rejected for the SVG pass. The SVG pass
preserves chart selection, sizing, and styling flags and injects inline-SVG
output for MCP clients; MCP does not return terminal or file output.

For the user-facing chart reference and examples, see `docs/charts/index.md`.
That guide covers workflows and examples in detail; this overview documents
where the chart docs, study rendering path, and MCP response rewrite fit
together.

## API Keys

Most commands work without credentials. Optional keys improve rate limits or
unlock additional data:

| Key | Source | Effect |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `NCBI_API_KEY` | PubTator3, PMC OA, NCBI ID converter | Higher rate limits |
| `S2_API_KEY` | Semantic Scholar article enrichment/navigation | Optional authenticated Semantic Scholar requests at 1 req/sec; shared-pool requests run at 1 req/2sec without the key |
| `OPENFDA_API_KEY` | OpenFDA | Higher rate limits |
| `NCI_API_KEY` | NCI CTS trial search (`--source nci`) | Required for NCI source |
| `ONCOKB_TOKEN` | OncoKB production API | Full clinical data (demo available without) |
| `ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY` | AlphaGenome variant effect prediction | Required for AlphaGenome |

For demo and offline workflows: `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` enables infinite
cache mode, replaying prior responses without hitting upstream APIs.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is process-local. Multiple concurrent CLI invocations or MCP
server workers do NOT share a limiter. For deployments with many concurrent
agent workers, run a single shared `biomcp serve-http` endpoint so all workers
share one limiter budget and one Streamable HTTP `/mcp` surface.

## Release Pipeline

The semver tag is the canonical release/version authority. PR CI enforces
version parity before release via the `version-sync` job and
`scripts/check-version-sync.sh`. The release workflow builds binaries,
publishes PyPI wheels, and deploys docs from the tagged source, while
`install.sh` resolves the latest release with platform assets, not the latest
merge to `main`. The existing `### Post-tag public proof` block is the live
verification step for tag-to-binary and tag-to-docs parity.
`workflow_dispatch` can replay a specified tag, but only as an explicit-tag
rebuild path, not a second source of release truth.

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `manifest.json`, `CITATION.cff`, and `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. Cut a GitHub release with a semver tag
4. GitHub Actions validates and publishes:
   - CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs five parallel jobs: `check` (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `make check-quality-ratchet`), `version-sync` (`bash scripts/check-version-sync.sh`), `climb-hygiene` (`bash scripts/check-no-climb-tracked.sh`), and `contracts` (`cargo build --release --locked`, `uv sync --extra dev`, `uv run pytest tests/ -v --mcp-cmd "./target/release/biomcp serve"`, `uv run mkdocs build --strict`), and `spec-stable` (`cargo build --release --locked`, then `make spec-pr`).
   - Volatile live-network headings run separately in `.github/workflows/spec-smoke.yml`,
     which runs the full `make spec` suite on a schedule and by manual dispatch.
   - Release validation runs the Rust checks again, then
     `uv run pytest tests/ -v --mcp-cmd "biomcp serve"` and
     `uv run mkdocs build --strict`.
   - Release build jobs package cross-platform binaries, publish PyPI wheels,
     and deploy docs.
5. `install.sh` resolves the latest tagged release with downloadable assets

### Post-tag public proof

After the `v0.8.18` tag is published, hand these commands to the verify/devops
pass so release-visible version identity and docs parity are checked against
the live surfaces:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/genomoncology/biomcp/releases/latest | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tag_name'])"
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)" && BIOMCP_INSTALL_DIR="$tmpdir" BIOMCP_VERSION=v0.8.18 bash install.sh >/tmp/biomcp-install.log && "$tmpdir/biomcp" version | head -n 1
bioasq_page="$(mktemp)" && curl -fsSL -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://biomcp.org/reference/bioasq-benchmark/ >"$bioasq_page" && rg -q 'hf-public-pre2026' "$bioasq_page" && rg -q 'Phase A\+' "$bioasq_page" && rg -q 'Phase B' "$bioasq_page"
api_keys_page="$(mktemp)" && curl -fsSL -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://biomcp.org/getting-started/api-keys/ >"$api_keys_page" && rg -q 'shared Semantic Scholar pool at 1 req/2sec' "$api_keys_page" && rg -q 'authenticated quota at 1 req/sec' "$api_keys_page"
drug_page="$(mktemp)" && curl -fsSL -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://biomcp.org/user-guide/drug/ >"$drug_page" && rg -q 'Keytruda regulatory --region eu' "$drug_page" && rg -q 'EMA local data setup' "$drug_page" && rg -q 'available \(default path\)' "$drug_page"
```

Expected markers:

- latest release tag is `v0.8.18`
- installed binary starts with `biomcp 0.8.18`
- BioASQ route returns all shipped benchmark page markers
- live API Keys docs show both shared-pool and authenticated Semantic Scholar
  guidance
- live Drug docs show the EMA `--region` workflow and local-data setup copy
  together with the local-data path marker

Known issue: `uv sync --extra dev` may rewrite the editable root package
version in `uv.lock` during a release cut. Verify whether the lockfile
version bump should ship with the release commit.

## Verification Approach

BioMCP has six distinct verification and operator-inspection surfaces.

### 1. CI and Repo Gates

- `make check` is the required local ticket gate. In the current `Makefile`,
  that means `lint`, `test`, and `check-quality-ratchet`.
- CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the broader repo baseline in parallel:
  `check`, `version-sync`, `climb-hygiene`, `contracts`, and `spec-stable`.
- Docs-site validation and Python contract tests do not run under `make check`;
  they live in `make test-contracts` and the CI `contracts` job.
- The grounding implementation surfaces for this split are `Makefile`,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`.

### 2. Spec Suite (`spec/`)

BDD executable documentation written as `mustmatch` spec files. The suite
exercises CLI output at the command level using stable structural markers
(headers, table columns, query echoes) rather than brittle upstream data
values.

PR CI runs `make spec-pr` via the `spec-stable` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. That job builds the release binary first, then
relies on the Makefile's `target/release`-first `PATH` handling so specs do
not accidentally execute a stale `.venv/bin/biomcp`. Volatile live-network
headings run in the separate `Spec smoke (volatile live-network)` workflow
instead.

Run locally with `make spec`.

Important: `uv run` may execute a stale `.venv/bin/biomcp`. Either refresh
with `uv pip install -e .` or ensure `target/release` is ahead of `.venv/bin`
when running CLI specs.

### 3. `biomcp health`

`biomcp health` is a curated operator inspection surface, not a full source
inventory ledger.

- The command is grounded in `src/cli/health.rs`.
- It shows per-source connectivity for readiness-significant sources.
- Key-gated sources appear as `excluded` rows when the required environment
  variable is absent.
- `--apis-only` omits the cache-writability row and the EMA local-data row
  because neither is an upstream API.
- Partial upstream failures remain visible in the rendered report.
- Current CLI behavior is report-first: the command exits `0` when the report
  renders, even if some upstream rows are failing.

### 4. Contract Smoke Checks (`scripts/contract-smoke.sh`)

`scripts/contract-smoke.sh` is an optional live probe runner for a selected set
of stable public endpoints, not a universal ledger for every integrated source.

- Many covered sources use happy / edge / invalid trios.
- Coverage is selective and operationally curated.
- Secret-gated, volatile, or otherwise unsuitable providers may be skipped or
  reduced.
- The grounding implementation surfaces are `scripts/contract-smoke.sh`,
  `scripts/README.md`, and `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`.

Contract smoke checks run in `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`.

Run: `./scripts/contract-smoke.sh` from the repo root.

### 5. Demo Scripts (`scripts/genegpt-demo.sh`, `scripts/geneagent-demo.sh`)

End-to-end demo flows that reproduce paper-style GeneGPT and GeneAgent
workflows. These scripts:
- Run live against the default binary
- Assert on JSON field presence (not exact values)
- Compute a scoring metric (evidence score for GeneGPT, drug count for GeneAgent)
- Exit non-zero on any assertion failure

These are the canonical smoke checks for a working release.

### 6. Remote HTTP Demo Artifact (`examples/streamable-http/streamable_http_client.py`)

Release verification for the Streamable HTTP surface also includes the
standalone Streamable HTTP demo client
(`examples/streamable-http/streamable_http_client.py`). Run `biomcp serve-http`, then execute:

```bash
uv run --script examples/streamable-http/streamable_http_client.py
```

The demo initializes against `/mcp` and prints `Command:` framing before a
three-step discovery -> evidence -> melanoma trials workflow through the remote
`biomcp` tool:

- `biomcp search all --gene BRAF --disease melanoma --counts-only`
- `biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" clinvar`
- `biomcp search trial -c melanoma --mutation "BRAF V600E" --limit 5`

Expected structural output includes the connection line and `Command:` markers
so the remote run remains readable in screenshots and recorded demos without
replacing the real BioMCP markdown output.

## Known Constraints

- Rate limiting is process-local (see above)
- Semantic Scholar participates in article search fan-out only on the
  compatible `search article --source all` path
- Semantic Scholar always owns TLDR, citations, references, and
  recommendations
- Federated totals are approximate
- Some sources (OncoKB production, NCI CTS, AlphaGenome) require API keys
- OncoKB demo endpoint has a known no-hit response for some variants — this
  is expected behavior, not a bug
- PubTator coerces small `size` parameters — use fixed internal page sizes
  (25) to avoid offset drift in pagination
- ClinicalTrials.gov mutation discovery cannot rely on `EligibilityCriteria`
  alone; search mutation-related title, summary, and keyword fields too

## Operator Notes

Runtime operator docs now live in `architecture/technical/staging-demo.md` and
`RUN.md`. Use those documents for the shared target, promotion contract, and
exact release-binary run/smoke commands, then use `scripts/` for the source
probe inventory and demo helpers.
