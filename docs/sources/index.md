# Biomedical Data Sources for AI Agents

BioMCP's [User Guide](../user-guide/cli-reference.md) is organized around entities such as genes, variants, articles, trials, and drugs. This Sources section flips the lens: it shows what each upstream database is good at, what BioMCP exposes from it, and where the boundary sits when a workflow is mixed-source.

Use these pages when you already know the provider you trust, the keyword you are targeting, or the provenance you need to explain to a reviewer, teammate, or downstream agent.

## Source guides
