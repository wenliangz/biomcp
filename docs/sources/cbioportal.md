description: "Use BioMCP to add cBioPortal cohort-frequency context to variants and download local study datasets for BioMCP study analytics."

# cBioPortal

cBioPortal matters when a single variant or gene question turns into a cohort question. It is the source page to use when you need cancer-study frequencies, downloadable study datasets, or local analytics that operate on a concrete study instead of a live one-record API lookup.

In BioMCP, the variant `cbioportal` section adds best-effort cohort frequency context, while `study` is BioMCP's local cBioPortal analytics family for downloaded datasets. Use `study download` to install a study into your local root and `study query` when you want per-study mutation, CNA, or expression summaries.

## What BioMCP exposes

| Command | What BioMCP gets from this source | Integration note |
|---|---|---|
| `get variant <id> cbioportal` | Cohort-frequency context for a variant | Best-effort cBioPortal enrichment section |
| `study download --list` | List of downloadable study IDs | Local analytics entry point |
| `study download <study_id>` | Local installation of one study dataset | Downloads into the default study root or `BIOMCP_STUDY_DIR` |
| `study query --study <id> --gene <symbol> --type <mutations|cna|expression>` | Per-study summaries for one gene | Local analytics workflow over downloaded files |

## Example commands

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" cbioportal
```

Returns a variant section with best-effort cBioPortal cohort frequency context.

```bash
biomcp study download --list
```

Returns a list of downloadable cBioPortal-style study IDs.

```bash
biomcp study download msk_impact_2017
```

Downloads the named study into the configured local study root.

```bash
biomcp study query --study msk_impact_2017 --gene TP53 --type mutations
```

Returns a per-study mutation summary for TP53 from local study files.

## API access

No BioMCP API key required. Local study analytics use downloaded datasets in the default study root or `BIOMCP_STUDY_DIR`.

## Official source
