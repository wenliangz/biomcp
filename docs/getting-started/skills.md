# Skills

BioMCP ships one embedded guide plus supporting reference files and worked
examples for agent workflows. The current workflow is:

```bash
biomcp skill
biomcp skill list
biomcp skill article-follow-up
biomcp skill install ~/.claude
```

## Read the overview

`biomcp skill` prints the embedded `skills/SKILL.md` overview. Start there if
you want the current BioMCP workflow guidance without installing anything into
an agent directory.

## Learn the workflows

Use `biomcp skill list` to browse the embedded worked examples and
`biomcp skill <slug|number>` to open one in the CLI:

```bash
biomcp skill list
biomcp skill article-follow-up
```

Current builds ship examples for treatment lookup, symptom lookup,
gene-disease orientation, and article follow-up. The installed `skills/` tree
also includes worked examples you can read directly in the repo or in an agent
directory:

- [Guide Workflows](../how-to/guide-workflows.md) - variant pathogenicity,
  drug safety, and broad gene-disease investigation

## Install into an agent directory

Install the embedded `skills/` tree into your agent directory:

```bash
biomcp skill install ~/.claude
```

Force replacement of an existing install:

```bash
biomcp skill install ~/.claude --force
```

The `dir` argument can point at an agent root such as `~/.claude`, an existing
`skills/` directory, or a `skills/biomcp/` directory. When you omit `dir`,
BioMCP attempts supported agent-directory detection in your home directory and
the current working tree, then prompts before installing when stdin is a TTY.

## Install payload

Current builds install the full embedded reference tree into
`<agent>/skills/biomcp/`, including:

- `SKILL.md`
- `use-cases/`
- `jq-examples.md`
- `examples/`
- `schemas/`
