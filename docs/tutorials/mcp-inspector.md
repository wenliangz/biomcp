# Testing BioMCP with MCP Inspector: Step-by-Step Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through using the MCP Inspector to test and debug
BioMCP integration. The MCP Inspector provides a user-friendly interface to
interact with BioMCP directly, without needing to integrate with an AI
assistant first.

## What is the MCP Inspector?

The MCP Inspector is a tool developed by Anthropic that allows you to:

- Test MCP servers like BioMCP directly
- Browse available tools and their parameters
- Send test requests and view responses
- Debug MCP server integrations

## Step 1: Start MCP Inspector

To run biomcp inside the MCP inspector, use the following command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --with biomcp-python biomcp run
```

This will launch the inspector interface (usually at http://127.0.0.1:6274).

## Step 2: Connect

Press the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the MCP server.

## Step 3: List Tools

The Inspector should display the available BioMCP tools:

- `article_searcher`
- `article_details`
- `trial_searcher`
- `trial_protocol`
- `trial_locations`
- `trial_outcomes`
- `trial_references`
- `variant_searcher`
- `variant_details`

Click on any tool to see its description and input parameters.

## Step 4: Test BioMCP Tools

Let's test each BioMCP tool with example inputs. For each test:

1. Select the tool from the list
2. Copy and paste the corresponding JSON input
3. Click "Call Tool" to send the request
4. Review the response in the Output section

### Tool 1: article_searcher

**Input:**

```json
{
  "genes": ["EGFR"],
  "diseases": ["NSCLC"],
  "variants": ["BRAF V600E"],
  "keywords": ["MEK Inhibitors"],
  "chemicals": ["Afatinib"]
}
```

**Example Output:**

```markdown

### Tool 3: trial_searcher

**Input:**

```json
{
  "conditions": ["Lung Cancer"],
  "interventions": ["Pembrolizumab"],
  "recruiting_status": "OPEN",
  "phase": "PHASE3"
}
```

**Example Output:**

```markdown
