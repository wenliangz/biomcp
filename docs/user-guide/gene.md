# Gene

Use gene commands to retrieve canonical metadata and targeted biological context.

## What the gene guide covers

- symbol-based retrieval,
- lightweight search,
- section expansion,
- JSON output for downstream systems.

## Search genes

Start with search when you are unsure of symbol spelling or aliases.

```bash
biomcp search gene BRAF --limit 5
```

Useful fields in search output typically include symbol, Entrez ID, and species.

## Get a gene record

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF
```

The default gene view is concise and intended for orientation.

## Request deeper sections

BioMCP expands detail via positional sections.

Pathway view:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF pathways
```

Disease associations:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF diseases
```

Ontology terms:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF ontology
```

Protein summary:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF protein
```

When UniProt exposes legacy protein names, the protein section includes an
`Also known as:` line with alternative full names and short names from UniProt.
When UniProt exposes alternative products, the same section also includes an
`Isoforms (N)` line with isoform names and the displayed isoform length when
that length is available from the base UniProt record.

GO terms and interactions:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF go interactions
```

CIViC evidence summary:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF civic
```

Tissue expression (GTEx):

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF expression
```

Protein tissue expression and localization (Human Protein Atlas):

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF hpa
```

Druggability profile (DGIdb interactions plus OpenTargets tractability and safety):

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF druggability
```

Gene-disease validity (ClinGen):

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF clingen
```

Constraint metrics (gnomAD):

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF constraint
```

Multiple sections can be chained:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF pathways diseases
```

All supported sections:

```bash
biomcp get gene BRAF all
```

## Helper commands

```bash
biomcp gene trials BRAF --limit 5
biomcp gene drugs BRAF --limit 5
biomcp gene pathways BRAF
biomcp gene articles BRAF
biomcp gene definition BRAF
```

## Common workflows

### Clinical trial pivot

```bash
biomcp search trial -c melanoma --mutation "BRAF V600E" --limit 5
```

### Literature pivot

```bash
biomcp search article -g BRAF -d melanoma --limit 5
```

### Variant pivot

```bash
biomcp search variant -g BRAF --limit 5
```

## Error handling expectations

If a section name is unsupported, BioMCP returns an explicit unknown-section message
with hints about valid section names.

## JSON mode

Use JSON for pipelines or agent post-processing.

```bash
biomcp --json get gene BRAF
```

`biomcp --json get gene BRAF druggability` includes DGIdb interaction fields plus
OpenTargets `tractability[]` modality summaries and `safety_liabilities[]` event summaries.

## Practical tips

- Keep section requests narrow for better focus.
- Start with one section, then add another only if needed.
- Use `search` first when symbol ambiguity is possible.
