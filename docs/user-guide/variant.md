# Variant

Use variant commands for compact annotation, source-backed interpretation context,
and optional predictive and population-genetics sections.

## Accepted variant identifiers

BioMCP supports multiple input forms:

- rsID: `rs113488022`
- HGVS genomic: `chr7:g.140453136A>T`
- gene-protein form: `BRAF V600E`, `BRAF p.Val600Glu`

These exact formats are accepted by `biomcp get variant` and the exact-ID
helper commands.

## Get a variant record

```bash
biomcp get variant rs113488022
biomcp get variant "chr7:g.140453136A>T"
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E"
biomcp get variant "BRAF p.Val600Glu"
```

The default output favors concise, clinically relevant context first.

Shorthand such as `PTPN22 620W` or `R620W` is not treated as an exact variant
ID. Use `biomcp search variant` for those inputs.

## Request variant sections

Prediction section:

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" predict
```

ClinVar-focused section:

```bash
biomcp get variant rs113488022 clinvar
```

ClinVar JSON also exposes `top_disease` when condition aggregation is available,
reusing the highest-ranked ClinVar condition row already shown in the section.

Population section:

```bash
biomcp get variant "chr7:g.140453136A>T" population
```

Population JSON exposes additive compact frequency fields:
`allele_frequency_raw` and `allele_frequency_percent`. Markdown keeps the raw
gnomAD AF line and appends the compact percent inline.

CIViC section:

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" civic
```

GWAS section (trait associations from GWAS Catalog):

```bash
biomcp get variant rs7903146 gwas
```

GWAS JSON exposes `supporting_pmids` as an ordered, deduplicated array. `null`
means the GWAS section was not loaded; `[]` means the section loaded but no
PMIDs were available.

Predictions (aggregated prediction scores):

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" predictions
```

Conservation (GERP, phyloP):

```bash
biomcp get variant rs113488022 conservation
```

COSMIC (somatic mutation data):

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" cosmic
```

CGI (Cancer Genome Interpreter annotations):

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" cgi
```

cBioPortal (frequency data):

```bash
biomcp get variant "BRAF V600E" cbioportal
```

All supported sections:

```bash
biomcp get variant rs113488022 all
```

## Helper commands

```bash
biomcp variant trials "BRAF V600E"   # search trials mentioning this mutation
biomcp variant articles "BRAF V600E" # search PubMed for this variant
biomcp variant oncokb "BRAF V600E"   # OncoKB lookup (requires ONCOKB_TOKEN)
```

## Search variants

By gene and protein change:

```bash
biomcp search variant -g BRAF --hgvsp V600E --limit 5
biomcp search variant -g BRAF --hgvsp p.Val600Glu --limit 5
biomcp search variant BRAF p.Val600Glu --limit 5
```

By residue alias shorthand:

```bash
biomcp search variant "PTPN22 620W" --limit 5
```

By protein shorthand when gene context is already supplied:

```bash
biomcp search variant -g PTPN22 R620W --limit 5
```

Standalone protein shorthand like `R620W` returns variant-specific recovery
guidance instead of falling back to gene or condition discovery.

By significance:

```bash
biomcp search variant -g BRCA1 --significance pathogenic --limit 5
```

With population and score filters:

```bash
biomcp search variant -g BRCA1 --max-frequency 0.01 --min-cadd 20 --limit 5
```

## Search GWAS associations

By gene:

```bash
biomcp search gwas -g TCF7L2 --limit 10
```

By trait:

```bash
biomcp search gwas --trait "type 2 diabetes" --limit 10
```

Trait search uses GWAS Catalog trait endpoints first, then study-association fallback paths when needed.

## Optional enrichment

Variant base output may include cBioPortal enrichment when available.
OncoKB is accessed explicitly via `biomcp variant oncokb "<gene> <variant>"` and requires `ONCOKB_TOKEN`.

## Prediction requirements

Prediction sections may require `ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY` depending on source path.
Unsupported inputs are surfaced with explicit validation messages.

## JSON mode

```bash
biomcp --json get variant "BRAF V600E"
biomcp --json get variant rs7903146 gwas
biomcp --json search gwas --trait "type 2 diabetes"
```
