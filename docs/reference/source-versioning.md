# Source Versioning Matrix

This matrix tracks which upstream API endpoints are version-pinned and where unversioned endpoints remain intentional.

## Notes

- If a provider introduces a stable version path, update the corresponding `src/sources/*.rs` base constant and this table in the same change.
- gnomAD versioning is handled by dataset selection in GraphQL variables and is verified by dataset fallback tests.
