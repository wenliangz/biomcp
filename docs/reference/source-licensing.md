# Source Licensing and Terms

BioMCP itself is MIT-licensed, but the data providers it queries are not all licensed the same way.

Three distinctions matter:

- BioMCP does not vendor, mirror, or ship upstream datasets in the repository.
- BioMCP performs on-demand read-only queries against upstream services.
- Returned records, downloaded full text, saved output, and downstream reuse can still be governed by upstream provider terms.

Use this page for provider terms, licensing, redistribution, and account requirements. Use [API Keys](../getting-started/api-keys.md) for setup steps and [Data Sources](data-sources.md) for runtime behavior, endpoints, rate limits, and operational caveats.

The canonical machine-readable inventory for this page lives in [`sources.json`](sources.json).

## How to read this page

- `tier`
  Tier `1` means baseline BioMCP usage works without credentials.
  Tier `2` means the BioMCP feature needs provider credentials, registration, or a provider-controlled account path.
  Tier `3` means BioMCP can query the provider, but notable reuse, redistribution, attribution, or policy caveats need explicit attention.
- `integration_mode`
  `direct_api` means BioMCP calls the provider directly.
  `indirect_only` means BioMCP only surfaces that provider as provenance through another API payload.
- `bioMcp_auth`
  `none` means BioMCP does not need a key for that provider.
  `optional_env` means an environment variable improves quota or access quality but is not required for baseline use.
  `required_env` means the feature requires a configured environment variable.
  `not_applicable` means there is no standalone BioMCP auth path because the provider is indirect-only.

- BioMCP auth: `not_applicable`
- Provider access / registration: surfaced indirectly through cached MyVariant.info fields; no standalone BioMCP COSMIC client

- Official terms URL: <https://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/cosmic-licensing/>
- Reviewed on: `2026-03-20`
- Notes: This is the most important indirect-only caution row. BioMCP intentionally does not support direct COSMIC querying because of licensing risk.

- Official terms URL: <https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/drugsfda/>
- Reviewed on: `2026-03-20`
- Notes: BioMCP documents Drugs@FDA as an indirect provenance label because approval fields arrive through OpenFDA, not a dedicated Drugs@FDA client.

### MONDO

- BioMCP surfaces: `search disease; discover <query>`
- Integration mode: `indirect_only`
- BioMCP auth: `not_applicable`
- Provider access / registration: surfaced indirectly through MyDisease.info payloads

- Reviewed on: `2026-03-20`
- Notes: BioMCP currently exposes PDB identifiers from UniProt rather than querying RCSB PDB directly.

## Source notes

- `PubMed` is an umbrella label in BioMCP output. In practice, article search and annotation use `PubTator3`, `Europe PMC`, `PMC OA`, and `NCBI ID Converter`. This page maps those aliases back to the actual provider rows instead of creating duplicate inventory entries.
- `OpenFDA FAERS`, `OpenFDA label`, `OpenFDA shortage`, and `Drugs@FDA` are user-facing provenance labels that resolve back to the `OpenFDA` direct row plus the `Drugs@FDA` indirect row.
- `AlphaFold DB` and `PDB` are indirect-only because BioMCP currently surfaces those structure IDs via `UniProt` cross-references rather than maintaining standalone source clients.
- `COSMIC` is indirect-only provenance through `MyVariant.info`. Direct COSMIC integration is not part of BioMCP's supported source surface because the provider's licensing model creates unacceptable redistribution and deployment risk for an MIT-licensed open tool.
