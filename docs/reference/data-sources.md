# Data Sources

BioMCP unifies multiple biomedical data providers behind one CLI grammar.
This reference explains source provenance, authentication requirements, base endpoints,
and operational caveats so users can reason about result quality and troubleshooting.

## Global HTTP behavior

All HTTP-based sources share a common client with:

- Connect timeout: 10 seconds
- Request timeout: 30 seconds
- Retries: exponential backoff, up to 3 retries for transient failures
- Disk cache: `~/.cache/biomcp/http-cacache` (platform-adjusted cache root)

For freshness-sensitive workflows, use `--no-cache`.

## Authentication requirements

BioMCP only requires API keys for a subset of sources.

| Source | Environment variable | Required when |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| AlphaGenome | `ALPHAGENOME_API_KEY` | Running `get variant <id> predict` |
| Semantic Scholar | `S2_API_KEY` | Adding the optional `search article` Semantic Scholar leg; running `article citations|references|recommendations`; enriching `get article` with TLDR and influence data |
| NCI CTS API | `NCI_API_KEY` | Trial operations with `--source nci` |
| OncoKB | `ONCOKB_TOKEN` | Running `variant oncokb <id>` |
| DisGeNET | `DISGENET_API_KEY` | Running `get gene <symbol> disgenet` or `get disease <name_or_id> disgenet` |
| NCBI E-utilities | `NCBI_API_KEY` | Optional; improves PubTator3, PMC OA, and NCBI ID Converter quota headroom |
| OpenFDA | `OPENFDA_API_KEY` | Optional; improves quota headroom |
| UMLS | `UMLS_API_KEY` | Optional clinical crosswalk enrichment for `biomcp discover <query>` |

## Source-specific rate and payload constraints

Upstream services can change quotas without notice, so BioMCP documents enforced limits
and practical ceilings observed in command behavior.

| Source / command path | BioMCP-enforced limit | Practical guidance |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| OpenFDA adverse-event / recall / device | `--limit` must be 1-50 | Use narrower filters and iterative queries for large pulls |
| Gene search | `--limit` must be 1-50 | Start with small limits, then increase |
| Variant search | `--limit` must be 1-50 | Use `--gene` + `--consequence` to reduce noise |
| PGx (CPIC) | Rate-limited to 1 request / 250ms | Keep result limits focused around target gene/drug |
| PGx annotations (PharmGKB) | Rate-limited to 1 request / 500ms | Treat as enrichment; core PGx data remains from CPIC |
| GWAS search (`search gwas`) | `--limit` must be 1-50 | Prefer specific gene or trait queries to avoid broad result sets |
| Trial search | `--limit` defaults to 10, supports pagination | Use `--offset` to page and keep filters stable |
| Article search | `--limit` defaults to 10 | Use `--since` and typed entity filters to constrain results; `sort=relevance` is local directness-first reranking |
| KEGG pathway search/detail | Rate-limited to 1 request / 334ms | Matches KEGG's published 3 requests / second guidance |
| Semantic Scholar article helpers | 1 request / second, process-local | Use explicit helper commands and batch normalization for multi-paper recommendation inputs |
| DisGeNET `disgenet` sections | Server-enforced; trial accounts may return first-page-only results and `429` with `X-Rate-Limit-Retry-After-Seconds` | Keep requests explicit, avoid fan-out loops, and retry after the server-provided cooldown |

## Trial source behavior

BioMCP supports two trial backends with similar command syntax but different retrieval behavior.

| Source flag | Backend | Strengths | Caveats |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| `--source ctgov` (default) | ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 | No API key, broad public coverage | Query behavior can vary with complex advanced terms |
| `--source nci` | NCI CTS API | Alternative indexing, oncology-focused source | Requires `NCI_API_KEY` and NCI-specific availability |

## Article pipeline behavior

Article workflows compose multiple APIs for different tasks:

1. PubTator3 + Europe PMC for federated search, with optional Semantic Scholar search when `S2_API_KEY` is set (parallel fan-out, identifier-aware merge across PMID/PMCID/DOI, local directness-first relevance ranking)
2. Europe PMC for bibliographic metadata
3. PubTator3 for entity annotations
4. Semantic Scholar for the optional search leg, TLDR, citation graph, influential citation counts, and recommendations
5. NCBI ID converter + PMC OA for full-text resolution where available

This means metadata, annotations, and fulltext may have different availability for the same PMID.

## OpenFDA behavior

OpenFDA drives three BioMCP features:

- FAERS drug adverse events
- Drug/device recalls
- MAUDE device events

OpenFDA may return no results for highly specific filters even when broader filters succeed.
Start broad (`--drug`, `--type`) and then tighten with `--reaction`, `--outcome`, `--classification`, or date filters.

## Provenance expectations

BioMCP output intentionally preserves source identity and record identifiers.
Users should always be able to trace:

- Which source produced the data
- Which identifier anchors the record (e.g., NCT, PMID, MONDO, rsID)
- Which sections come from direct source fields vs normalized rendering

## Operations checklist

When debugging source discrepancies:

1. Run `biomcp health --apis-only` to inspect per-source connectivity plus any excluded key-gated sources
2. Treat `biomcp health` as an inspection surface: it does not currently exit non-zero on partial upstream failures
3. Run `./scripts/contract-smoke.sh --fast` for representative live probes, or `./scripts/contract-smoke.sh` for the fuller contract set
4. Retry with `--no-cache`
5. Confirm required API keys are set for optional sources
6. Switch source when applicable (`--source ctgov` vs `--source nci`)
7. Reduce filter complexity and retest
