# Changelog

## 0.8.17 — 2026-03-23

### New sources

- Added WikiPathways as a third pathway source alongside Reactome and KEGG,
  with source-aware section handling plus operator proof coverage in
  `biomcp health` and `scripts/contract-smoke.sh`. (025)
- Added an optional Semantic Scholar search leg to `search article` when
  `S2_API_KEY` is set, merging PubTator3, Europe PMC, and Semantic Scholar
  results with identifier-aware deduplication and directness-first ranking.
  (034)
- Added KEGG as a pathway source alongside Reactome and WikiPathways.
- Added gnomAD constraint metrics for variant-interpretation context.
- Added Human Protein Atlas tissue expression to gene output.
- Added ComplexPortal-backed protein complex data.
- Added DisGeNET gene-disease association scores.

### New commands

- Added `biomcp discover <query>` as the free-text concept-resolution
  entrypoint, using OLS4 as the required backbone with optional UMLS
  crosswalks and MedlinePlus disease/symptom context. (028)
- Added `biomcp article batch <id>...` for compact multi-article summary
  cards with parallel article fetch and optional batched Semantic Scholar
  enrichment; the command is limited to 20 IDs. (037)

### Improvements

- Restored pathway progressive disclosure and exact-title-first ranking, so
  default pathway cards stay concise and exact pathway-title matches rise to
  the top across sources. (017)
- Expanded operator proof surfaces and refreshed source-aware architecture docs
  so the shipped source inventory, API-key handling, proof expectations, and
  section-availability rules are explicit and consistent. (018, 019, 030)
- Improved protein complexes terminal layout and normalized pathway CLI usage
  errors and remediation. (020, 021)
- Added source labels and missing evidence URLs across entity detail outputs in
  Markdown and JSON for stronger traceability. (022, 025)
- Added paper/reproducibility and community-packaging artifacts, including
  `paper/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `.zenodo.json`. (023)
- `get gene` and `get drug` misses now return discovery-backed canonical
  suggestions with structured `_meta.alias_resolution` /
  `_meta.next_commands` guidance instead of dead-end errors. (029)
- Help, `list`, and docs now surface working typed paths, and `search all` /
  `search article` can emit `--debug-plan` routing metadata in Markdown or
  JSON when requested. (032)
- Typed variant retrieval now accepts common shorthand forms, emits
  variant-scoped recovery guidance on misses, and accepts long-form protein
  notation such as `AKT2 p.Pro50Thr`. (033, 039)
- `search all` cross-routing now stays inside controlled typed fallback rules,
  reducing noisy drill-downs and duplicate follow-up commands. (035)
- Typed retrievals now expose compact answer-bearing summaries for approvals,
  population frequencies, and disease/variant evidence without removing the
  detailed sections. (036)
- Deepened OpenTargets integration with tractability and
  genetic-association sections.
- Added JATS-aware PMC full-text extraction for article detail views.
- MCP chart responses can now return SVG inline as a base64 image payload.
- Polished Kuva chart output with human-readable labels and KM curve
  improvements.
- Suppressed retry-middleware warnings from stderr.
- Pathway output now keeps section availability truthful and gives better
  guidance when a source lacks a section.

### Fixes

- Fixed drug interaction output so supported drugs no longer return empty
  interaction sections.
- Fixed g:Profiler enrichment timeouts.
- Fixed the DisGeNET template crash on sparse or null payloads such as
  `biomcp get gene KYNU disgenet`. (031)
- Fixed default article retraction filtering so only confirmed retractions are
  excluded; PubTator3 and Semantic Scholar rows with unknown retraction status
  remain visible. (038)

## 0.8.16 — 2026-03-17

- Adopted the shared `bin/lint` script and wired `make lint` / `make check`
  to the March repo convention for Rust repos.
- Refreshed the README, homepage, CLI reference, and helper docs so the public
  release docs match the current BioMCP command surface.
- Expanded `skills/SKILL.md` for article graph helpers, `enrich`, `batch`,
  chart discovery, chart flags, and updated drug interaction guidance.
- Updated the Kuva chart blog post with checked-in SVG outputs for all nine
  worked examples plus placeholder references for terminal screenshots.
- Added Semantic Scholar article enrichment and helpers for TLDR, citations,
  references, and recommendations.
- Added Kuva-backed study chart rendering plus chart discovery/docs for SVG
  study outputs.
- Trial search now accepts fractional ages such as `0.5 years`.
- Generated `_meta.next_commands` now pass a parser-level validity gate, and
  article JSON guidance is cleaner and more truthful.
- Fixed federated article search offset and sort semantics with correctness
  coverage.
- Breaking MCP runtime change: renamed the MCP execution tool from `shell` to
  `biomcp`; update MCP clients and demos to call `biomcp` after `tools/list`.
- Added `CITATION.cff` and citation pointers in the README and public docs.
- Fixed Semantic Scholar references to use cited papers instead of referenced
  papers.
- Fixed article search timeouts on `--exclude-retracted`.
- Fixed article retraction filtering and unary `NOT` parsing.
- Stabilized CTGov trial pagination and age-filtered totals: improved cursor
  behavior, aligned count/search params, clarified trial-filter guidance, and
  exposed approximate age-only counts when exact totals are too expensive.
- Expanded release-quality gates with contracts CI, version-sync checks, a
  PR-gated spec suite, stable/smoke lane splitting, and protein entity spec
  coverage.
- Updated lockfiles for the `quinn-proto` and `PyJWT` vulnerability
  advisories.
- Refined the Streamable HTTP demo into a tested end-to-end BRAF/melanoma
  workflow with a focused README and Python 3.11 compatibility.

## 0.8.15 — 2026-03-11

- Fixed the planning-docs CI path regression so release validation uses the
  repo-local planning fixtures by default instead of an Ian-local absolute
  path. This is the fix from PR #191 that unblocks release packaging on
  GitHub Actions.
- Refreshed the public discovery docs so `search all` is taught as the unified
  cross-entity entry point in the README and docs index. This is the docs
  alignment from PR #190.

## 0.8.14 — 2026-03-10

- Promoted remote Streamable HTTP in newcomer docs with a dedicated getting-started page for `biomcp serve-http`.
- Added a runnable PEP 723 demo client at `demo/streamable_http_client.py` for `/mcp`, including a `tools/list` flow and `biomcp version` tool call.
- Surfaced the canonical remote HTTP routes more prominently across public docs: `/mcp`, `/health`, `/readyz`, and `/`.
- Kept `serve-sse` migration guidance visible while shipping the Streamable HTTP release/docs/demo verification package together.
- Reranked disease search results so exact-match canonical names surface first.
- `search article` now rejects unsupported identifiers with explicit contract guidance instead of falling through ambiguously.
- Defaulted article search sorting to relevance across CLI entry points.
- Normalized search aliases, identifiers, and trial phase semantics across entity searches.
- Broadened trial mutation matching across title, summary, keyword, and eligibility fields.
- Removed stale skill-discovery UX and refreshed `list` / help output to match the shipped CLI surface.

## 0.8.13 — 2026-03-09

- `study survival` now reports Kaplan-Meier median survival, 1/3/5-year survival landmarks, and two-group log-rank p-values.
- Fixed survival median calculation: replaced raw follow-up median with Kaplan-Meier median survival.
- `study compare --type expression` now reports Mann-Whitney U and p-value.
- Added `study download <study_id>` and `study download --list` for local cBioPortal datahub installs.
- Hardened `study download`: no total body timeout for large archives, path-like study ID rejection, stream-to-disk download, and cleanup on failed extraction.
- Refreshed `skills/SKILL.md` with real study command usage, including `cohort`, `filter`, and `survival --endpoint` examples.

## 0.8.12 — 2026-03-07

- Added `study` subcommand: local cBioPortal study adapters with CLI query surface (`download`, `cohort`, `survival`, `compare`).
- Added `study filter`: multi-omics cross-table sample joins across mutation, CNA, expression, and clinical data.
- Added Fisher exact p-values to co-occurrence pair analysis.
- Added skill installer auto-discovery: scans existing agent config directories in priority order and supports the `.agents/skills/` cross-tool standard.
- Refreshed skill guidance and reference material: adopted the measured `SKILL.md` refresh and added drift validation for examples, schemas, and jq snippets.
- CLI quality pass: positional search arguments, multi-token input handling, variant fallback, NCT ID validation, bare-entity shortcuts, staged trial fill, article request timeout, and `--until` alias.

## 0.8.11 — 2026-03-06

- Added `expression` section to gene output (GTEx tissue-specific TPM data).
- Added `druggability` section to gene output (DGIdb drug-gene interactions and categories).
- Added `clingen` section to gene output (gene-disease validity and dosage sensitivity).
- Added evidence URLs (`_meta.evidence_urls`) to all entity output — includes Ensembl, OMIM, NCBI Gene, and UniProt links where available.
- Added `spec/` BDD documentation suite with 54 passing executable specifications.
- Unified article search: fan-out across PubTator3 and Europe PMC in parallel with PMID deduplication, source-grouped rendering, and `--source <all|pubtator|europepmc>`.
- Added infinite cache mode via `BIOMCP_CACHE_MODE=infinite` for offline/demo workflows.
- Consolidated CI into a single job; streamlined release pipeline.
- Added reusable presentations infrastructure with an intro deck, branded theme assets, and slide templates for BioMCP talks.
- Hardened PyPI release packaging for arm64 and portable version syncing in the release workflow.

## 0.8.10 — 2026-03-04
