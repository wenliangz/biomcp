# Skill Workflows

BioMCP now ships a concise overview plus an embedded worked-example catalog. This
file validates the layered skill behavior: overview, catalog listing, and opening
numbered or slugged examples through the existing `show_use_case()` path.

| Section | Command focus | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Skill overview | `biomcp skill` | Confirms the overview is routing-first and concise |
| List worked examples | `biomcp skill list` | Confirms the embedded catalog is populated |
| Open numeric example | `biomcp skill 01` | Confirms numbered use-cases still resolve |
| Open slug example | `biomcp skill article-follow-up` | Confirms slug lookups open the expected markdown |

## Skill Overview

The overview should teach routing rules and then point the user to the worked
examples instead of inlining every workflow.

```bash
out="$(biomcp skill)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "## Routing rules"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "## Section reference"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "## Cross-entity pivot rules"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "## Output and evidence rules"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like 'Run `biomcp skill list` for worked examples'
```

## Listing Skills

`biomcp skill list` should now render the embedded worked-example catalog.

```bash
out="$(biomcp skill list)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# BioMCP Worked Examples"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "01 treatment-lookup"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "02 symptom-phenotype"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "03 gene-disease-orientation"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "04 article-follow-up"
```

## Viewing a Skill by Number

Numeric addressing should open the numbered worked example through the existing
loader and show executable commands, not a not-found error.

```bash
out="$(biomcp skill 01)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Pattern: Treatment / approved-drug lookup"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like 'biomcp search drug --indication "myasthenia gravis" --limit 5'
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "biomcp get drug pyridostigmine"
```

## Viewing a Skill by Slug

Slug addressing should open the matching worked example and preserve the
citation/recommendation workflow commands.

```bash
out="$(biomcp skill article-follow-up)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Pattern: Article follow-up via citations and recommendations"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "biomcp article citations 22663011 --limit 5"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "biomcp article recommendations 22663011 --limit 5"
```
