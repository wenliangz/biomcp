# Disease Queries

Disease commands normalize labels to ontology-backed identifiers and provide cross-entity pivots. This file validates melanoma-centric disease workflows including genes, trials, articles, and drugs. Assertions focus on stable schema and identifier markers rather than dynamic counts.

| Section | Command focus | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Disease search | `search disease melanoma` | Confirms disease normalization output |
| Disease detail | `get disease melanoma` | Confirms canonical disease card |
| Disease genes | `get disease melanoma genes` | Confirms association section rendering |
| Disease to trials | `disease trials melanoma` | Confirms trial helper path |
| Disease to articles | `disease articles melanoma` | Confirms literature helper path |
| Disease to drugs | `disease drugs melanoma` | Confirms treatment helper path |

## Searching by Name

Search should return ontology-backed disease rows and canonical MONDO identifiers. We assert table schema and the melanoma MONDO ID marker.

```bash
out="$(biomcp search disease melanoma --limit 3)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "| ID | Name | Synonyms |"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "MONDO:0005105"
```

## Getting Disease Details

The disease detail card should resolve the query label to a normalized concept. This check targets heading and canonical ID line.

```bash
out="$(biomcp get disease melanoma)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# melanoma"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "ID: MONDO:0005105"
```

## Disease Genes

Associated-gene expansion is central for translating phenotype-level queries into molecular follow-up. We assert on section heading and table structure.

```bash
out="$(biomcp get disease melanoma genes)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "## Associated Genes"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "| Gene | Relationship | Source |"
```

## Disease to Trials

Disease helper commands should map directly into trial search with condition context retained. The check asserts query echo and trial columns.

```bash
out="$(biomcp disease trials melanoma --limit 3)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "condition=melanoma"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "|NCT ID|Title|Status|Phase|Conditions|"
```

## Disease to Articles

Disease-linked literature retrieval supports rapid evidence triage. Assertions check heading context and the article table schema.

```bash
out="$(biomcp disease articles melanoma --limit 3)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Articles: disease=melanoma"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "| PMID | Title |"
```

## Disease to Drugs

Disease-to-drug pivoting provides treatment-oriented context when starting from diagnosis. The output should include indication heading and compact drug table.

```bash
out="$(biomcp disease drugs melanoma --limit 3)"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "# Drugs: indication=melanoma"
echo "$out" | mustmatch like "|Name|Mechanism|Target|"
```
