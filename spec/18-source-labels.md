# Source Labels

This spec verifies that `get` entity detail responses carry explicit source
labels in both markdown and JSON output. Assertions are structural — they check
for stable provenance strings, not volatile upstream data values.

| Section | Command focus | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown labels | `get <entity>` | Confirms visible source attribution at section boundaries |
| JSON section_sources | `get <entity> --json` | Confirms `_meta.section_sources` with stable key/label/sources fields |

## Markdown Source Labels

Each entity type must name its upstream source at visible section boundaries.

```bash
bin="${BIOMCP_BIN:-biomcp}"
gene_out="$("$bin" get gene CFTR all)"
echo "$gene_out" | mustmatch like "Source: NCBI Gene / MyGene.info"
echo "$gene_out" | mustmatch like "## Summary (NCBI Gene)"

drug_out="$("$bin" get drug ivacaftor targets)"
echo "$drug_out" | mustmatch like "## Targets (ChEMBL / Open Targets)"

variant_drug_out="$("$bin" get drug rindopepimut targets)"
echo "$variant_drug_out" | mustmatch like "Variant Targets (CIViC): EGFRvIII"

disease_out="$("$bin" get disease "cystic fibrosis")"
echo "$disease_out" | mustmatch like "## Definition (MyDisease.info)"
echo "$disease_out" | mustmatch like "Genes (Open Targets):"

trial_out="$("$bin" get trial NCT06668103)"
echo "$trial_out" | mustmatch like "Source: ClinicalTrials.gov"

protein_out="$("$bin" get protein P15056 complexes)"
echo "$protein_out" | mustmatch like "## Complexes (ComplexPortal)"

pgx_out="$("$bin" get pgx CYP2D6 recommendations)"
echo "$pgx_out" | mustmatch like "## Recommendations (CPIC)"

ae_out="$("$bin" get adverse-event 10329882)"
echo "$ae_out" | mustmatch like "## Reactions (OpenFDA)"
```

## JSON section_sources — Gene, Drug, Disease

Core entity types must include a non-empty `_meta.section_sources` array.

```bash
bin="${BIOMCP_BIN:-biomcp}"
gene_json="$("$bin" get gene CFTR all --json)"
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "summary"'
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "identity"'
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "NCBI Gene"'

drug_json="$("$bin" get drug ivacaftor all --json)"
echo "$drug_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$drug_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "safety"'
echo "$drug_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "targets"'
echo "$drug_json" | mustmatch like "OpenFDA FAERS"
echo "$drug_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "ChEMBL"'

variant_drug_json="$("$bin" get drug rindopepimut --json)"
echo "$variant_drug_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "variant_targets"'
echo "$variant_drug_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "Variant Targets"'
echo "$variant_drug_json" | mustmatch like '"sources": ['

disease_json="$("$bin" get disease "cystic fibrosis" --json)"
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "definition"'
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "top_genes"'
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "recruiting_trials"'
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like "MyDisease.info"
echo "$disease_json" | mustmatch like "ClinicalTrials.gov"
```

## JSON section_sources — Variant, Trial, Article

```bash
variant_json="$(biomcp get variant rs334 --json)"
echo "$variant_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$variant_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "identity"'
echo "$variant_json" | mustmatch like "MyVariant.info"

trial_json="$(biomcp get trial NCT06668103 --json)"
echo "$trial_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$trial_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "overview"'
echo "$trial_json" | mustmatch like "ClinicalTrials.gov"

article_json="$(biomcp get article 22663011 --json)"
echo "$article_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$article_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "bibliography"'
echo "$article_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "PubMed"'
```

## JSON section_sources — Pathway, Protein, PGX, Adverse Event

Reactome pathway cards are slower than the other entity types in this group, so
the identity proof runs on its own to stay within the shared spec timeout while
still checking the same `_meta.section_sources` contract.

```bash
pathway_json="$(biomcp get pathway R-HSA-5358351 --json)"
echo "$pathway_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$pathway_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "identity"'
echo "$pathway_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "Reactome"'
```

The remaining entity families respond quickly enough to keep in one block while
still verifying their identity and section-level source labels.

```bash
wp_json="$(biomcp get pathway WP254 --json)"
echo "$wp_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$wp_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "identity"'
echo "$wp_json" | mustmatch like "WikiPathways"

protein_json="$(biomcp get protein P15056 --json)"
echo "$protein_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$protein_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "identity"'
echo "$protein_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "UniProt"'

pgx_json="$(biomcp get pgx CYP2D6 --json)"
echo "$pgx_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$pgx_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "CPIC"'

ae_json="$(biomcp get adverse-event 10329882 --json)"
echo "$ae_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
echo "$ae_json" | mustmatch like '"key": "reactions"'
echo "$ae_json" | mustmatch like '"label": "OpenFDA"'
```

## Backward Compatibility

Adding `section_sources` must not break the existing `_meta` contract.

```bash
gene_json="$(biomcp get gene CFTR --json)"
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"evidence_urls": ['
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"next_commands": ['
echo "$gene_json" | mustmatch like '"section_sources": ['
```
