Is distribution of tidal ventilation during volume-targeted ventilation variable and influenced by age in the preterm lung?,response,During SIPPV + VTV the preterm infant exhibits marked breath-to-breath variability in regional ventilation which is influenced by age.,"['Synchronised volume-targeted ventilation (SIPPV + VTV) attempts to reduce lung injury by standardising volume delivery to the preterm lung. The aim of this study is to describe the regional distribution and variability of ventilation within the preterm lung during SIPPV + VTV. Twenty-seven stable, supine, preterm infants with <32 weeks gestation receiving SIPPV + VTV were studied. From each infant, the anterior-to-posterior impedance change due to tidal ventilation (∆Z (VT); countless units) was determined during every breath from three, 30-s, electrical impedance tomography recordings. ∆Z (VT) within the anterior, middle and posterior thirds of the chest were compared using area under the curve analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) of ∆Z (VT) in the anterior and posterior hemithoraces, inflation pressure and, where available, V (T) at airway opening were compared. Infants were sub-grouped by age (≤7 and >7 days), supplemental oxygen requirement and set tidal volume. In all sub-groups, the middle third of the chest accounted for the greatest ∆Z (VT) [p < 0.0001, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. The middle third of the chest constituted a greater relative ∆Z (VT) in infants aged >7 days compared with ≤7 days (p < 0.0001, repeated-measures ANOVA). Set tidal volume and oxygen requirement did not significantly influence the regional distribution of ∆Z (VT). The mean (standard deviation, SD) CV of ∆Z (VTANT) and ∆Z (VTPOST) were 30.6% (14.0%) and 31.9% (12.7%). ∆Z (VTANT) and ∆Z (VTPOST) expressed greater breath-to-breath variability than the variation in inflation pressure and V (T) at airway opening (p = 0.012 and p < 0.0001, respectively, paired t-tests).']"
Does microRNA-762 promote breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting IRF7 expression?,response,These results demonstrate that miR-762 tumour effect was achieved by targeting IRF7 in human breast cancer specimens.,"['miRNAs play crucial roles in human tumourigenesis. This study was performed to measure expression and function of miR-762 in breast cancer. Expression of miR-762 in breast tissues and cell lines (SK-BR-3, DA-MB-435s, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, HBL-100) was measured by using real-time RT-PCR. We restored expression of miR-762 in MCF-7 cells to measure its functional roles. Luciferase assays were performed to reveal the target gene of miR-762. Expression of miR-762 was high in both breast cancer cell lines and specimens, and its overexpression increased breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is a direct target of miR-762 and overexpression of miR-762 reduced expression of IRF7. Moreover, IRF7 was repressed, its levels inversely correlated to miR-762 expression. IRF7 rescued miR-762-induced cell invasion and proliferation.']"
Can Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics before Prostate Biopsy Predict the Malignant Potential of Prostate Cancer?,response,"In PCa patients treated with other therapies besides prostatectomy, a high PSA velocity and a low %fPSA may predict high grade PCa with a Gleason sum≥8 or the presence of extracapsular invasion.","['To predict the malignant potential of prostate cancer (PCa) according to prostate-specific antigen velocity (PSAV), PSA density (PSAD), free/total PSA ratio (%fPSA), and digital rectal examination (DRE).

Is snus the same as dip?,response,Smokers repeated some messages featured in early snus advertising. Snus was not seen as an acceptable substitute for smoking or way to quit cigarettes. Current smoker responses to snus advertising are not consistent with harm reduction.,"[""Since 2006, leading US cigarette companies have been promoting new snus products as line extensions of popular cigarette brands. These promotional efforts include direct mail marketing to consumers on cigarette company mailing lists. This study examines smokers' reactions to this advertising and perceptions of the new snus products. Eight focus groups (n=65 participants) were conducted in San Francisco and Los Angeles in 2010 with smokers who received tobacco direct mail advertising. The focus group discussions assessed smokers' perceptions of the new snus products. Focus group videos were transcribed and coded using Transana software to identify common themes. Most participants were aware of snus advertising and many had tried free samples. Most were aware that snus was supposed to be 'different' from traditional chewing tobacco but consistently did not know why. Participants willing to try snus still identified strongly as smokers, and for some participants, trying snus reinforced their preference for smoking. Snus' major benefits were use in smoke-free environments and avoiding social stigma related to secondhand smoke. Participants were sceptical of the idea that snus was safer than cigarettes and did not see it as an acceptable substitute for cigarettes or as a cessation aid.""]"
Risk behaviour in Swedish adolescents: is shared physical custody after divorce a risk or a protective factor?,response,"Shared physical custody after marriage break-up seems to constitute a health protective factor for adolescents' health and problem behaviour.

Does cYR61 modulate the vascular endothelial growth factor C expression of decidual NK cells via PI3K/AKT pathway?,response,"The upregulation of VEGFC secretion mainly depends on CYR61 binding with integrin αvβ3 on the surface of dNK cells. PI3K/AKT, rather than the ERK/MAPK signal, is involved in the regulation.","['Either vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) or CYR61 plays an important role in placental development and may be involved in pre-eclampsia. Decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are the main source of VEGFC in the maternal-fetal interface. However, it is unclear about CYR61 on the regulation of VEGFC secretion in dNK cells. Decidual natural killer cells were isolated from decidual tissues of first trimester of pregnancy with anti-human CD56-conjugated microbeads. Integrin αvβ3 was detected using immunofluorescent staining. dNK cells were cultured in the presence of CYR61, anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody (LM609), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), or MEK inhibitor (U0126). VEGFC mRNA and protein were evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Exogenous CYR61 induced the expression of VEGFC in dNK cells in both mRNA and protein levels. Integrin αvβ3 was strongly expressed on dNK cell surface. Anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody inhibited the effect of CYR61 on VEGFC expression. LY294002, but not U0126, significantly reduced this promotion effect of CYR61 on dNK cells.']"

"Are complexes between the LKB1 tumor suppressor , STRAD alpha/beta and MO25 alpha/beta upstream kinases in the AMP-activated protein kinase cascade?",response,These results provide the first description of a physiological substrate for the LKB1 tumor suppressor and suggest that it functions as an upstream regulator of AMPK. Our findings indicate that the tumors in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome could result from deficient activation of AMPK as a consequence of LKB1 inactivation.,"[""The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) cascade is a sensor of cellular energy charge that acts as a 'metabolic master switch' and inhibits cell proliferation. Activation requires phosphorylation of Thr172 of AMPK within the activation loop by upstream kinases (AMPKKs) that have not been identified. Recently, we identified three related protein kinases acting upstream of the yeast homolog of AMPK. Although they do not have obvious mammalian homologs, they are related to LKB1, a tumor suppressor that is mutated in the human Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome. We recently showed that LKB1 exists as a complex with two accessory subunits, STRAD alpha/beta and MO25 alpha/beta. We report the following observations. First, two AMPKK activities purified from rat liver contain LKB1, STRAD alpha and MO25 alpha, and can be immunoprecipitated using anti-LKB1 antibodies. Second, both endogenous and recombinant complexes of LKB1, STRAD alpha/beta and MO25 alpha/beta activate AMPK via phosphorylation of Thr172. Third, catalytically active LKB1, STRAD alpha or STRAD beta and MO25 alpha or MO25 beta are required for full activity. Fourth, the AMPK-activating drugs AICA riboside and phenformin do not activate AMPK in HeLa cells (which lack LKB1), but activation can be restored by stably expressing wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, LKB1. Fifth, AICA riboside and phenformin fail to activate AMPK in immortalized fibroblasts from LKB1-knockout mouse embryos.""]"

This prospective case series evaluated 56 patients with acute or chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease to assess the sensitivity and specificity of cTn-I for detecting myocardial injury in this patient population. During a 6-month period, patients admitted with suspected myocardial injury by history, physical examination, and electrocardiography were evaluated. Cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) measurements were assessed between 8 and 48 h after admission. Appropriate medical care and further cardiac testing (echocardiography, stress testing, or arteriography) was performed at the discretion of the primary physician.

Eighty percent of patients who failed to clear their stones had a double-J stent.","['To determine the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in the treatment of pediatric nephrolithiasis and to analyze the impact of renal stone size and location on stone clearance. This was a retrospective case series of pediatric patients (14 years or younger) undergoing lithotripsy using a Dornier MPL 9000 echo-guided lithotriptor. Patients were identified using an international coding and indexing system (9th edition) and ESWL registry. One hundred five patients were treated from January 1990 to December 2001. Stone clearance was assessed at 1 and 3 months. A stone-free state was defined as no radiologic evidence of stone or fragments 3 mm or less. Treatment failure was analyzed to find any correlation with stone size and site. The overall stone-free rate was 95%. The treatment failed in 5 patients, who subsequently required ancillary procedures. Three patients received one session of ESWL, after which they were lost to treatment and were not analyzed further. Four of the five patients with treatment failure had a double-J stent; the stones were located in the lower pole calix in 2, renal pelvis and lower pole calix in 1, and at the ureteropelvic junction in 2 patients. The mean stone size in the treatment failure group was 15.88 mm compared with 14 mm in the stone-free group. The complication rate was 8%, but only 3 patients required admission.']"
Does larger tumor size predict nodal involvement in patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma?,response,"Lymph node dissection must be planned only in the case of large follicular thyroid carcinomas. Since follicular carcinoma is usually diagnosed postoperatively, more attention should be paid to nodal involvement in the tumor re-staging during follow-up of those patients with tumors larger than 4.0 cm in diameter.","['Lymph node metastases are rare in patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma, with an average incidence of 5.5% of all cases reported in the literature. In the present study we focused on the search for risk factors predictive of lymph node involvement in patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma to plan the most appropriate management and follow-up. We carried out a cross-sectional study among patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma and lymph node metastasis at diagnosis and patients without lymph node involvement. From January 1998 to April 2008, 930 patients underwent thyroidectomy in our surgical department for a variety of thyroid disorders, 420 (45.2%) of them for a differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The medical records of 55 patients with histological diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma were analyzed. Four patients (7.3%) had lymph node metastasis from follicular thyroid carcinoma at presentation in both the lateral and central neck compartments. Mean tumor size was significantly greater for follicular thyroid carcinomas with nodal metastasis (5.1 ± 1.4 cm) than for those without nodal involvement (3.0 ± 1.2 cm, P <0.010). Among factors supposed to influence the presence of nodal metastasis at diagnosis (age, gender, tumor size, multifocality, tumor poorly differentiated, tumor widely invasive, vascular invasion, thyroid capsular invasion, and extra thyroid invasion), tumor size larger than 4.0 cm was the only factor retained in the multivariate statistical model.']"
Gastrostomy tube placement in infants and children: is there a preferred technique?,response,"Minimally invasive PEG and LAP techniques have supplanted the open technique for most patients. Operative time for PEG placement is shorter than other methods, and patients chosen for the PEG method of placement are older and of greater weight. However, there were significant and more serious postoperative complications requiring a second operation in the PEG group when compared with the LAP group.","['Advances in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and laparoscopic (LAP) techniques, including LAP-assisted PEG, offer alternatives to the standard open gastrostomy technique. This study compares the outcomes of the PEG and LAP techniques. All gastrostomy tube placements were reviewed at our institution from January 2004 to October 2008. Demographic, procedural, and outcome data were collected. Univariate and logistic regression statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and P<or = .05 considered significant. Of 238 gastrostomy tubes placed, 134 were PEG (56.3%) and 104 were LAP (43.7%). Most tubes were inserted for failure to thrive (74.4%) and feeding difficulties (52.1%). Patient weight and age were increased and operative time decreased for PEG compared with other methods. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy patients also had a statistically higher number of postoperative complications, requiring a return trip to the operating room (P = .02).']"
Does providing more accessible primary care psychology services lower the clinical threshold for referrals?,response,The lack of evidence for a reduction in clinical threshold for referral within the primary care sample suggests that general practitioners' referral rates are similar regardless of whether practice-based clinical psychology services are available. This has implications for primary-care-led commissioning of mental health services.,"['The growing number of specialist services being provided within primary care has lead to the argument that this will reduce the clinical threshold for referrals to these clinics.AIM: The possibility that increasing the accessibility of primary care psychology services will reduce the threshold for referral was examined by comparing levels of psychological disturbance among patients seen by practice-based clinical psychologists with those attending outpatient clinics. Psychological symptoms, distress, disruption in daily life and satisfaction with life were assessed using a questionnaire-based methodology. A consecutive series of 177 patients, assessed in a local general practice or an outpatient department across a wide range of urban locations, was studied over a fixed period. The study revealed equivalent levels of psychopathology within both specialist and primary care clinics. Of the overall sample, 79% were likely to merit a formal psychiatric diagnosis, relating primarily to mood disorder. Levels of subjective distress and life satisfaction were also equivalent at both service locations.']"
Are somatic symptoms and diseases more common in women exposed to violence?,response,"Violence was associated with the presence of somatic symptoms and diseases. The more a woman is exposed to violence, the higher the number of somatic symptoms and diseases reported is.","['Exposure to violence has been shown to have an impact on somatic health. However, our knowledge about the possible dose-response relationship between frequency of violence exposure and health is still limited. To study the associations between recent and repetitive exposure to violence and presence of somatic symptoms and diseases in women. Cross-sectional, community-based, self-reporting survey. Two thousand seven hundred thirty women aged 18-40 years (mean age 30.5 years). The somatic symptom scale derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders was used to obtain information on the presence of somatization. In addition, we asked about the presence of 11 diseases or organ-specific diseases. Exposure to violence was measured by the Abuse Assessment Screen. Eighteen percent (486/2,730) of women surveyed reported exposure to physical violence. Three percent (94/2,730) had been forced into sexual intercourse as an adult. All somatic symptoms, and several diseases, were significantly more common in women exposed to physical and/or sexual violence as compared to nonexposed women. Women exposed to 3 or more violent episodes in the past 12 months reported a presence of 4.8 somatic symptoms and 1.2 diseases (mean) as compared to 1.8 symptoms and 0.5 diseases in nonexposed women. Women with exposure to both physical and sexual violence reported 6.0 symptoms and 1.5 diseases. The impact of violence on somatic symptoms and diseases remained after controlling for depression and sociodemographic factors.']"
Are clinical trials dealing with severe infection fitting routine practices?,response,Current exclusion criteria for RCTs dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock excluded most patients encountered in daily practice and limit external validity of the results of high-quality studies.,"['Guidelines dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock mostly rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to ensure the best standards of care for patients. However, patients included in high-quality studies may differ from the routine population and alter external validity of recommendations. We aimed to determine to what extent non-inclusion criteria of RCTs dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock may affect application of their conclusions in routine care. In a first step, the MEDLINE database was searched for RCTs treating severe sepsis and septic shock patients between 1992 and 2008, and non-inclusion criteria for these studies were abstracted. Two reviewers independently evaluated the articles, which were checked by a third reviewer. We extracted data on the study design, main intervention, primary endpoint, criteria for inclusion, and criteria for non-inclusion. In a second step, the distribution of the non-inclusion criteria was observed in a prospective multicenter cohort of severe sepsis and septic shock patients (Cub-Rea network, 1992 to 2008). We identified 96 articles out of 7,012 citations that met the screening criteria. Congestive heart failure (35%) and cancer (30%) were frequent exclusion criteria in selected studies, as well as other frequent disorders such as gastrointestinal and liver diseases and all causes of immune suppression. Of the 67,717 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the Cub-Rea database, 40,325 (60%) experienced at least one of the main exclusion criteria, including 11% of congestive heart failure patients and 11% of cancer patients. In addition, we observed a significant trend for increasing number of patients with these criteria along time.']"
Repeat Imaging in Idiopathic Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis: Is It Necessary?,response,"Patients initially diagnosed with iUVFP may have an occult cause that later becomes evident. We recommend repeat imaging within 2 years after diagnosis, but this is likely unnecessary beyond 5 years.","['Imaging plays a critical role in the evaluation of patients presenting with unilateral vocal fold paresis or paralysis of unknown etiology. In those with idiopathic unilateral vocal fold paralysis (iUVFP), there is no consensus regarding the need or timing of repeat imaging. This study seeks to establish the rate of delayed detection of alternate etiologies for these patients to determine if and when imaging should be repeated. Retrospective chart review was conducted identifying patients at our institution with vocal fold movement impairment between 1998 and 2014. Idiopathic paralysis was diagnosed if physical examination, laryngoscopy, and initial imaging excluded a cause. Demographic data, length of follow-up, and the presence of late lesions were noted. Time to detection was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of 3210 patients reviewed, 207 had a diagnosis of iUVFP. Of these patients, 8 went on to develop alternate diagnoses, including pulmonary disease, skull-base and laryngeal neoplasms, and thyroid malignancy. In Kaplan-Meir analysis, 90% remained ""idiopathic"" at 5 years of follow-up. The mean time to detection was 27 months.']"
Does effects of ventilation on hearing loss in preterm neonates : Nasal continuous positive pressure increase the risk of hearing loss in ventilated neonates?,response,There is no increase in the hearing loss in preterm neonates treated with NCPAP as compared to mechanical ventilation despite being exposed to higher environmental noise generated by the NCPAP.,"['There is increased risk of hearing loss in preterm neonates. This risk is further increased by environmental noise exposure especially from life support equipment such as ventilation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) used for respiratory support of preterm neonates is known to be associated with prolonged exposure to high levels of noise. However, there is paucity of information on the effect of NCPAP as compared to mechanical ventilation on hearing loss among preterm neonates. A retrospective chart review was performed on neonates with birth weight (BW) <1500g. Association of clinical factors including the use of NCPAP and mechanical ventilation with failure of hearing screen were studied. Those who failed hearing screen were followed for 2 years to observe long term effects of NCPAP on the hearing loss. Of 344 neonates included in the study, 61 failed hearing screen. Gestational age (p=0.008), BW (p=0.03), ventilation (p=0.02), intrauterine growth retardation (p=0.02), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (p=0.02), apnea (p<0.001), use of vancomycin (p=0.01) and furosemide (p=0.01) were associated with failure of hearing screen. On multivariate analysis, ventilation (OR 4.56, p=0.02), apnea (OR 2.2, p<0.001) and NEC (OR 2.4, p=0.02) were predictors of failed hearing screen. As compared to those not ventilated, the odds of failing hearing screen was 4.53 (p<0.01) and 4.59 (p<0.01) for those treated with NCPAP and mechanical ventilation respectively, with there being no difference between these two ventilatory modalities. Of the 61 neonates, 42 were followed for 2 years, of which 19 had confirmed hearing loss.

Do chromosome X-encoded cancer/testis antigens show distinctive expression patterns in developing gonads and in testicular seminoma?,response,"Most CT-X antigens are expressed in human fetal germ cells after they have lost stem cell characteristics, with predominant expression in pre-meiotic germ cells. Spermatocytic seminomas showed expression of all CT-X antigens except SPANX, whereas classical seminomas only express some CT-X antigens, reflecting their different origins from adult versus fetal germ cells.","['Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are cancer antigens normally expressed in adult testicular germ cells. The expression of chromosome X-encoded CT antigens (CT-X antigens) in human fetal gonads and in testicular seminomas was examined. The expression of 10 CT-X antigens (MAGEA, NY-ESO-1, GAGE, CT7/MAGEC1, CT10/MAGEC2, CT45, SAGE1, SSX2, NXF2 and SPANX) was studied immunohistochemically. In adult human testis, SPANX is expressed in late spermatids and spermatozoa, whereas all other CT-X antigens are predominantly expressed in spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes. All CT-X antigens except SPANX are expressed in human fetal germ cells. CT-X-positive germ cells appear as early as 13 weeks after gestation, increase with age and reach a plateau at around 22 weeks. In the fetal ovary, CT-X-positive oogonia are most abundant at around 24 weeks and sharply decrease subsequently. CT-X antigens are almost exclusively expressed in OCT3/4-negative gonocytes and their expression appears to coincide with the loss of pluripotency. Spermatocytic seminoma, a neoplasm derived from adult pre-meiotic germ cells, showed uniform expression of all CT-X antigens except SPANX. In contrast, most seminomas (>80%) express CT7, CT45, GAGE and CT10 but express MAGEA, NXF2 and NY-ESO-1 at lower frequency, and very rarely express SSX2 and SAGE1.']"
Is impaired creatinine secretion after an intravenous creatinine load an early characteristic of the nephropathy of sickle cell anaemia?,response,"Patients with SCA have impaired response to the TST before there are reductions in glomerular filtration. Therefore, a reduction in the tubular secretory reserve capacity represents an early event in the nephropathy of this condition.","['The capacity to increase the tubular secretion of creatinine (TS(cr)) after an intravenous creatinine load (stimulated TS(cr)) has been found to be impaired in subclinical reduction of renal mass. We decided to investigate if this response was impaired in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients before there was evidence of deterioration of renal function. Studies were done in 16 patients with homozygous SCA who had normal or supranormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and in 20 normal controls of similar median age (23 years). The tubular stress test (TST) consisted of 30-min clearance periods ([(125)I]iothalamate and creatinine) done before (baseline) and after (three successive post-stimulation periods) the intravenous infusion of 88.4 micromol (10 mg) of creatinine per kg of body weight. Baseline studies showed that the SCA patients had higher GFR and lower serum creatinine concentration. After stimulation there were no changes in GFR. In contrast, creatinine clearance increased 2.3 times in normal but not in SCA patients (P<0.001) and the TS(cr) in the first post-stimulation period was 161+/-83 nmol/kg/min in SCA patients vs 286+/-93.2 in normal controls (P<0.001). The mean TS(cr) post-stimulation was also reduced in patients with SCA (123+/-52 nmol/kg/min vs 179+/-50 in normal controls, P<0.001). Since SCA patients had lower P(cr) values, separate analysis was made of post-load clearance periods in which P(cr) was comparable in patients and in normal controls (range 177-265 micromol/l or 2-3 mg/dl) and the reduction in TS(cr) was also present in SCA patients in these study periods.']"
Is uniparental inheritance of chloroplast DNA strict in the isogamous volvocalean Gonium?,response,"The present data suggest that the uniparental inheritance of cpDNA is likely more strict in crossings of less diverged strains or sexually compatible parental volvocaleans, and some genetic inconsistency between the parents may cause exceptional uniparental inheritance of cpDNA.","['A problem has remained unresolved regarding the exceptions to the unilateral inheritance of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from MT+/female in Chlamydomonas and other volvocaleans demonstrated by the previous genetic analyses.

In the present study, we used sexually compatible parents of the isogamous colonial volvocalean Gonium maiaprilis that seemed an ideal species to identify the pattern of cpDNA inheritance based on the length difference in the putative group I intron interrupted in the Rubisco large subunit gene and objective identification of mating types by the presence or absence of the minus-dominance (MID) gene. We examined patterns of inheritance of cpDNA and presence/absence of a MID ortholog (GmMID) in 107 F(1) progeny of G. maiaprilis that were obtained by inducing germination of separated single zygotes. The results demonstrated no exception of the uniparental inheritance of cpDNA from the MT+ parent (lacking GmMID) in sexually compatible or genetically less divergent strains of G. maiaprilis.']"
Does induction of vascular progenitor cells from endothelial cells stimulate coronary collateral growth?,response,"We conclude that iVPCs, generated by partially reprogramming ECs, are an ideal cell type for cell-based therapy designed to stimulate coronary collateral growth.","['A well-developed coronary collateral circulation improves the morbidity and mortality of patients following an acute coronary occlusion.

We reprogrammed rat ECs with the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc. A population of reprogrammed cells was derived that expressed pluripotent markers Oct4, SSEA-1, Rex1, and AP and hemangioblast markers CD133, Flk1, and c-kit. These cells were designated iVPCs because they remained committed to vascular lineage and could differentiate into vascular ECs and VSMCs in vitro. The iVPCs demonstrated better in vitro angiogenic potential (tube network on 2-dimensional culture, tube formation in growth factor reduced Matrigel) than native ECs. The risk of teratoma formation in iVPCs is also reduced in comparison with fully reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). When iVPCs were implanted into myocardium, they engrafted into blood vessels and increased coronary collateral flow (microspheres) and improved cardiac function (echocardiography) better than iPSCs, mesenchymal stem cells, native ECs, and sham treatments.']"
Is airway hyperresponsiveness negatively associated with obesity or overweight status in patients with asthma?,response,"Obesity is a risk factor for asthma in the general population, but obesity in asthmatic patients is negatively correlated with the intensity of AHR and is not related to asthma severity.

To identify factors associated with subacute motor deterioration in PD patients with systemic inflammation. The association of clinical factors with subacute motor deterioration was analyzed by a case-control study. Subacute motor deterioration was defined as sustained worsening by one or more modified Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stages. Using multivariable logistic regression incorporating baseline characteristics (age, sex, PD duration, modified H-Y stage, dementia, and psychosis history) and statistically selected possible predictors (peak body temperature, duration of leukocytosis, and presence of delirium), the odds ratios for these factors were estimated as relative risks.

In the 26 cases, 6 months after its onset the motor deterioration had persisted in 19 patients and resolved in four (three were lost for follow-up). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that delirium and body temperature are significantly associated with motor deterioration after systemic inflammation (P = 0.001 for delirium and P = 0.026 for body temperature), the adjusted odds ratios being 15.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.23-78.14) and 2.78 (95% CI: 1.13-6.83), respectively.']"
Is circulating soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products inversely correlated to oxidized low-density lipoproteins in asymptomatic subjects?,response,"An independent, significant and inverse correlation was shown to exist between circulating levels of sRAGE and oxLDL (MDA-LDL),  which suggests that part of the antiatherosclerotic effects of sRAGE may be related to oxLDL quenching.","['There is growing evidence that circulating soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) exerts antiatherogenic effects as a decoy receptor that abolishes RAGE signalling.

We also examined the impact of AD signature cortical thinning or other biomarker changes (i.e., hippocampal atrophy, reduced CSF Aβ42, or increased CSF tau) on cognitive performance in CN individuals. Elevated CSF tau was associated with AD signature cortical thinning but not hippocampal atrophy. In contrast, decreased CSF Aβ42 was associated with hippocampal loss but not AD signature cortical thinning. In addition, AD signature cortical thinning was associated with lower visuospatial performance. Reduced CSF Aβ42 was related to poorer performance on episodic memory.']"
Does elevated Alkaline Phosphatase in Infants With Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease reflect Bone Rather Than Liver Disease?,response,"While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.","['Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD).

Do exposure to lipopolysaccharide and/or unconjugated bilirubin impair the integrity and function of brain microvascular endothelial cells?,response,"LPS and/or UCB exert direct toxic effects on BMEC, with distinct temporal profiles and mechanisms of action. Therefore, the impairment of brain endothelial integrity upon exposure to these neurotoxins may favor their access to the brain, thus increasing the risk of injury and requiring adequate clinical management of sepsis and jaundice in the neonatal period.","['Sepsis and jaundice are common conditions in newborns that can lead to brain damage. Though lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to alter the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), little is known on the effects of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and even less on the joint effects of UCB and LPS on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). Monolayers of primary rat BMEC were treated with 1 µg/ml LPS and/or 50 µM UCB, in the presence of 100 µM human serum albumin, for 4 or 24 h. Co-cultures of BMEC with astroglial cells, a more complex BBB model, were used in selected experiments. LPS led to apoptosis and UCB induced both apoptotic and necrotic-like cell death. LPS and UCB led to inhibition of P-glycoprotein and activation of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 in mono-cultures. Transmission electron microscopy evidenced apoptotic bodies, as well as damaged mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in BMEC by either insult. Shorter cell contacts and increased caveolae-like invaginations were noticeable in LPS-treated cells and loss of intercellular junctions was observed upon treatment with UCB. Both compounds triggered impairment of endothelial permeability and transendothelial electrical resistance both in mono- and co-cultures. The functional changes were confirmed by alterations in immunostaining for junctional proteins β-catenin, ZO-1 and claudin-5. Enlargement of intercellular spaces, and redistribution of junctional proteins were found in BMEC after exposure to LPS and UCB.']"

Dichloroacetate significantly decreased glucose production and increased the percentage of glucose directed toward oxidation in both healthy volunteers and septic patients. However, this dichloroacetate-induced perturbation of glucose utilization had no significant effect on whole-body protein breakdown or the efflux of specific amino acids from the leg except for alanine, whose net efflux doubled (P < or = .05).']"
"The transitive fallacy for randomized trials: if A bests B and B bests C in separate trials, is A better than C?",response,"Even with large sample sizes, combining results from a previous randomized trial of B versus C with results from a new randomized trial of A versus B will not guarantee correct inference about A versus C. A three-arm trial of A, B, and C would protect against this problem and should be considered when the sequential trials are performed in the context of changing secular trends in important omitted variables such as therapy in cancer screening trials.","[""If intervention A bests B in one randomized trial, and B bests C in another randomized trial, can one conclude that A is better than C? The problem was motivated by the planning of a randomized trial, where A is spiral-CT screening, B is x-ray screening, and C is no screening. On its surface, this would appear to be a straightforward application of the transitive principle of logic. We extended the graphical approach for omitted binary variables that was originally developed to illustrate Simpson's paradox, applying it to hypothetical, but plausible scenarios involving lung cancer screening, treatment for gastric cancer, and antibiotic therapy for clinical pneumonia. Graphical illustrations of the three examples show different ways the transitive fallacy for randomized trials can arise due to changes in an unobserved or unadjusted binary variable.

It also provided the program organisers with insights regarding timing and activities, which will be useful in improving future programs targeting secondary students.","[""The main aim of this pilot program was to raise secondary students' awareness of university studies and careers in the health sciences through a three-day program. Further aims of the program were to increase the participants' knowledge of health issues through group activities, and provide an opportunity to interact with university staff and health professionals. The participants were surveyed at the conclusion of the program using an online questionnaire (30 items) consisting of both open and closed questions. The program and evaluation were carried out at a regional campus of a metropolitan-based university during the mid-year vacation. Fourteen Year 10 students (11 female, 3 male; 5 from government schools, 9 from a non-government school) from a regional city completed the evaluation. Satisfaction with the program, increased awareness of pathways into university, and changes in attitude about university as a career option. The evaluation revealed that the participants had had a pleasant learning experience, which had led them to feel positive about university studies in general and as an option for themselves. They made useful suggestions for improvements.""]"
Is fructose malabsorption uncommon among patients with irritable bowel syndrome in India : a case-control study?,response,"Though FM was not very common among Indian patients with IBS, it was higher among them than controls. Patients with FM more often had diarrhea-predominant IBS.","[""Fructose malabsorption (FM) is reported in 38 % to 75 % patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Most of these studies, however, had limitations due to use of variable dose of fructose, small sample size, and lack of control population. Moreover, there is no study on this issue from India. Hence, in this prospective study, we evaluated the frequency of FM on an adequately powered sample of patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC) from India. Ninety-seven patients with IBS (diagnosed using Rome III criteria) and 41 healthy controls were evaluated for FM by fructose hydrogen breath test (FHBT) using 25 g fructose. Persistent rise (at least two readings) in breath hydrogen 20 parts per million (PPM) above basal was considered diagnostic of FM. Patients and controls were comparable in age (37 years [21-66] vs. 33 years [15-56]; p\u2009=\u20090.1) and gender (76/97 [78.4 %] vs. 29/41 [70.7 %] male; p\u2009=\u20090.3). Of 70 patients reporting data on Bristol's stool forms, 10 (14 %), 43 (61 %), and 17 (25 %) had constipation, diarrhea predominant and unclassified IBS (Asian classification), respectively. Patients with IBS more often had FM than controls on FHBT (14/97 [14.4 %] vs. 1/41 [2.4 %]; p\u2009=\u20090.04). Patients with FM more often had diarrhea-predominant IBS than those without FM (10/11 [91 %] vs. 33/59 [56 %]; p\u2009=\u20090.02).""]"
Recent Australian suicide trends for males and females at the national level: has the rate of decline differed?,response,"Australian males, an 'at risk' demographic, appear to be experiencing benefits from the existence of current national suicide prevention strategies and related social changes. It is recommended that greater consideration be given to researching risk factors such as intimate partner violence, sexual abuse, and substance dependence, for Australian female suicide.","['In keeping with international public health policy development, suicide prevention in Australia has received increasing attention. The mid to late 1990s saw the introduction of a range of co-ordinated national prevention programmes. Since 1997, suicides have decreased, but the comparative rates of decline for males and females have not been well studied at the national level. Standardised suicide rates were calculated for males and females, using data from 1997 to 2005. Linear models (ordinary least squares) were used to calculate rates of decline, with trends compared for males and females. Male suicides appear to have fallen more rapidly than female suicides.']"
Is bioavailable IGF-I associated with fat-free mass gains after physical training in women?,response,"Circulating bioavailable IGF-I has a moderate association with physical activity-induced increases in FFM accretion in young, healthy women, and this association is greater than observed for total IGF-I.","['The contributions of systemic versus local insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) action for mediating fat-free mass (FFM) accretion have yet to be fully clarified, but circulating IGF-I is the preferred measure in clinical practice, and its merits as a biomarker have been demonstrated for a number of physiological outcomes. To test the hypothesis that bioavailable IGF-I would have a stronger association with physical activity-induced FFM accretion than total IGF-I and would serve as a prognostic indicator of FFM accretion. Seventy-seven young healthy women (21 ± 5 yr, 62.7 ± 8.5 kg, 27.0% ± 6.0% body fat) participated in 8 wk of Army basic training involving intense physical activity. Total and bioavailable IGF-I; IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; and body composition parameters were measured before and after the training. There were significant (P≤0.05) increases in FFM (6%) and decreases in fat mass (-13%). Total IGF-I and IGFBP-4 to -6 increased, whereas IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 decreased. Bioavailable IGF-I (24%) explained three times the amount of variance in relative FFM changes than did total IGF-I (8%). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that women with lower baseline bioavailable IGF-I were twice as likely to experience FFM gains >7%. Women gaining >7% FFM had greater increases in total IGF-I, maintained bioavailable IGF-I concentrations and experienced greater decreases in IGFBP-2 and increases in IGFBP-6 than those women gaining <7% FFM.']"
Extraction site location and incisional hernias after laparoscopic colorectal surgery: should we be avoiding the midline?,response,"Although midline hernia rates were lower than traditionally reported with open surgery, midline extraction sites have a higher chance of IH than nonmidline sites.","['Laparoscopic colorectal procedures require specimen extraction. It is unclear whether extraction site affects the incidence of incisional hernia (IH). Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy over a 6-year period were identified. Outcomes were compared between patients to evaluate the incidence of hernia. Among 480 laparoscopic colorectal procedures, extraction sites were midline (n = 305), muscle splitting (n = 128), Pfannenstiel (n = 26), and ostomy (n = 21). Average follow-up was 3.5\xa0years. Age, gender, diagnosis, extraction incision length, and hospital stay were similar. The mean body mass index for all patients was 28 kg/m(2) and for those with IHs was 31 kg/m(2) (P = .008). The overall IH rate was 7%. Midline IHs accounted for 84% of all hernias, occurring in 8.9% of midline extractions (P<.05 vs nonmidline extractions). Hernia rates for muscle-splitting, Pfannenstiel, and ostomy site extractions were 2.3%, 3.8%, and 4.8%, respectively.']"
Is anti-L1CAM radioimmunotherapy more effective with the radiolanthanide terbium-161 compared to lutetium-177 in an ovarian cancer model?,response,Our study is the first to show that anti-L1CAM (161)Tb RIT is more effective compared to (177)Lu RIT in ovarian cancer xenografts. These results suggest that (161)Tb is a promising candidate for future clinical applications in combination with internalising antibodies.,"['The L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is considered a valuable target for therapeutic intervention in different types of cancer. Recent studies have shown that anti-L1CAM radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with (67)Cu- and (177)Lu-labelled internalising monoclonal antibody (mAb) chCE7 was effective in the treatment of human ovarian cancer xenografts. In this study, we directly compared the therapeutic efficacy of anti-L1CAM RIT against human ovarian cancer under equitoxic conditions with the radiolanthanide (177)Lu and the potential alternative (161)Tb in an ovarian cancer therapy model. Tb was produced by neutron bombardment of enriched (160)Gd targets. (161)Tb and (177)Lu were used for radiolabelling of DOTA-conjugated antibodies. The in vivo behaviour of the radioimmunoconjugates (RICs) was assessed in IGROV1 tumour-bearing nude mice using biodistribution experiments and SPECT/CT imaging. After ascertaining the maximal tolerated doses (MTD) the therapeutic impact of 50 % MTD of (177)Lu- and (161)Tb-DOTA-chCE7 was evaluated in groups of ten mice by monitoring the tumour size of subcutaneous IGROV1 tumours. The average number of DOTA ligands per antibody was 2.5 and maximum specific activities of 600 MBq/mg were achieved under identical radiolabelling conditions. RICs were stable in human plasma for at least 48 h. (177)Lu- and (161)Tb-DOTA-chCE7 showed high tumour uptake (37.8-39.0 %IA/g, 144 h p.i.) with low levels in off-target organs. SPECT/CT images confirmed the biodistribution data. (161)Tb-labelled chCE7 revealed a higher radiotoxicity in nude mice (MTD: 10 MBq) than the (177)Lu-labelled counterpart (MTD: 12 MBq). In a comparative therapy study with equitoxic doses, tumour growth inhibition was better by 82.6 % for the (161)Tb-DOTA-chCE7 than the (177)Lu-DOTA-chCE7 RIT.']"
Does nEDD9 regulate actin dynamics through cortactin deacetylation in an AURKA/HDAC6-dependent manner?,response,This study provides a mechanistic platform for therapeutic interventions based on AURKA and HDAC6 inhibition for patients with metastatic breast cancer to prevent and/or eradicate metastases.,"['The prometastatic protein NEDD9 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9) is highly expressed in many cancers and is required for mesenchymal individual cell migration and progression to the invasive stage. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of NEDD9-driven migration and the downstream targets effecting metastasis are not well defined. In the current study, knockdown of NEDD9 in highly metastatic tumor cells drastically reduces their migratory capacity due to disruption of actin dynamics at the leading edge. Specifically, NEDD9 deficiency leads to a decrease in the persistence and stability of lamellipodial protrusions similar to knockdown of cortactin (CTTN). Mechanistically, it was shown that NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of CTTN in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6-dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and Tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a decrease in the number of pulmonary metastases. Collectively, these findings identify CTTN as the key downstream component of NEDD9-driven migration and metastatic phenotypes.']"
Does sirolimus allow early cyclosporine withdrawal in renal transplantation resulting in improved renal function and lower blood pressure?,response,"Sirolimus, CsA, and steroids for 3 months posttransplant, followed by elimination of CsA, is a safe and effective alternative to continuous therapy with sirolimus, CsA, and steroids that can result in better renal function and lower blood pressure.","['This study evaluated whether cyclosporine (CsA) could be eliminated from a sirolimus (Rapamune, rapamycin, SRL)-CsA-steroid (ST) regimen at 3 months. This was an open-label study conducted in Europe, Australia, and Canada. Upon enrollment, 525 primary (90%) or secondary (10%) renal allograft recipients with cadaveric (89%) or living (11%) donors received 2 mg of sirolimus (troughs>5 ng/ml), CsA, and steroids. At 3 months+/-2 weeks, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to remain on SRL-CsA-ST or to have CsA withdrawn and therapy continued with SRL (troughs 20-30 ng/ml)-ST. At 12 months, overall graft and patient survival were 89.1% and 94.9%, respectively. In the 430 (82%) randomized patients, there was no difference in graft survival (95.8% vs. 97.2%, SRL-CsA-ST vs. SRL-ST) or patient survival (97.2% vs. 98.1%, respectively). The incidence of biopsy-confirmed primary acute rejection was 13.1% during the prerandomization period. After randomization, the acute rejection rates were 4.2% and 9.8% for SRL-CsA-ST and SRL-ST, respectively (P=0.035). Renal function (calculated glomerular filtration rate, 57 vs. 63 ml/min, P<0.001) and blood pressure significantly improved when CsA was withdrawn. Hypertension, CsA nephrotoxicity, hyperuricemia, and Herpes zoster occurred statistically more frequently in patients remaining on CsA, whereas thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and hypokalemia were reported more often for SRL-ST therapy.']"
Is fDG-PET assessment of rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy associated with long-term prognosis : a prospective evaluation?,response,"Assessment of rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy by FDG-PET provides no prognostic information. Therefore, serial FDG-PET before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should not be performed for this purpose.","['At present there is no defined role for routine FDG-PET in the preoperative evaluation of nonmetastatic rectal cancer. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of FDG-PET to predict long-term prognosis based on the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. This was a prospective study. This study was performed at an academic, tertiary care, comprehensive cancer center. One hundred twenty-seven patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were enrolled between September 1999 and December 2005. All patients underwent FDG-PET scans before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. FDG-PET parameters were evaluated by at least 2 study board-certified nuclear medicine physicians, and included mean standard uptake value, maximum standard uptake value, total lesion glycolysis, and visual response score. The main outcome measures were time to recurrence and disease-specific survival. Of 127 patients, 82 (65%) were men, the median age was 60 years (range, 27-82), 110 patients had stage II/III disease, and 17 patients had stage IV disease. Median follow-up among survivors was 77 months (range, 1-115 months). Nine patients had unresectable metastatic disease and were excluded from the time-to-recurrence analysis. At 5 years, 74% (95% CI = 66%-81%) of patients had not had recurrences (locally and/or distantly). The 5-year disease-specific survival was 89% (95% CI = 81%-93%). On univariate analysis, visual response score and time to recurrence came closest to having an association (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68-1.01, p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, the visual response score was not significant (p = 0.85). No FDG-PET parameter was associated with disease-specific survival.']"
Is surgical airway necessary for airway management in deep neck infections and Ludwig angina?,response,Treatment of Ludwig angina and deep neck abscesses requires good clinical judgment. Patients with deep neck infections and symptoms of airway compromise may be safely managed with advanced airway control techniques.,"['Deep neck infections are potentially life-threatening conditions because of airway compromise. Management requires early recognition, antibiotics, surgical drainage, and effective airway control. The Surgical Education and Self-Assessment Program 12 states that awake tracheostomy is the treatment of choice for these patients. With advanced airway control techniques such as retrograde intubation, GlideScope, and fiberoptic intubation, surgical airway is not required. A retrospective analysis of all deep neck abscesses treated from December 1999 to July 2006 was performed. All patients who underwent urgent or emergent surgery for Ludwig angina and submental, submandibular, sublingual, and parapharyngeal abscesses (Current Procedural Terminology codes 41015, 41016, 41017, 42320, and 42725) were included in our review. Charts were studied for age, presence of true Ludwig angina, presence of airway compromise, airway management, morbidity/mortality, and the requirement for surgical airway. Of 29 patients, 6 (20%) had symptoms consistent with true Ludwig angina. Nineteen (65.5%) had evidence of airway compromise. Eight (42%) of these 19 patients required advanced airway control techniques. No patient required a surgical airway, and no mortality resulted from airway compromise. Advance airway control techniques were required more often in patients with airway compromise (P<.05).']"
Does marek 's disease virus infection induce widespread differential chromatin marks in inbred chicken lines?,response,Our results confirm the presence of widespread epigenetic differences induced by MD in chicken lines with different levels of genetic resistance. A majority of observed epigenetic changes were indicative of increased levels of viral infection in the susceptible line symptomatic of lowered immunocompetence in these birds caused by early cytolytic infection. The GAL system that has known anti-proliferative effects in other cancers is also revealed to be potentially involved in MD progression. Our study provides further insight into the mechanisms of MD progression while revealing a complex landscape of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that varies depending on host factors.,"[""Marek's disease (MD) is a neoplastic disease in chickens caused by the MD virus (MDV). Successful vaccine development against MD has resulted in increased virulence of MDV and the understanding of genetic resistance to the disease is, therefore, crucial to long-term control strategies. Also, epigenetic factors are believed to be one of the major determinants of disease response. Here, we carried out comprehensive analyses of the epigenetic landscape induced by MDV, utilizing genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation maps from chicken lines with varying resistance to MD. Differential chromatin marks were observed on genes previously implicated in the disease such as MX1 and CTLA-4 and also on genes reported in other cancers including IGF2BP1 and GAL. We detected bivalent domains on immune-related transcriptional regulators BCL6, CITED2 and EGR1, which underwent dynamic changes in both lines as a result of MDV infection. In addition, putative roles for GAL in the mechanism of MD progression were revealed.""]"
Does glycation of low-density lipoproteins by methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde give rise to the in vitro formation of lipid-laden cells?,response,"These results are consistent with LDL glycation, in the absence of oxidation, being sufficient for rapid lipid accumulation by macrophage cells. Aldehyde-mediated ""carbonyl-stress"" may therefore facilitate the formation of lipid-laden (foam) cells in the artery wall.","['Previous studies have implicated the glycoxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by glucose and aldehydes (apparently comprising both glycation and oxidation), as a causative factor in the elevated levels of atherosclerosis observed in diabetic patients. Such LDL modification can result in unregulated cellular accumulation of lipids. In previous studies we have characterized the formation of glycated, but nonoxidized, LDL by glucose and aldehydes; in this study we examine whether glycation of LDL, in the absence of oxidation, gives rise to lipid accumulation in arterial wall cell types. Glycated LDLs were incubated with macrophage, smooth muscle, or endothelial cells. Lipid loading was assessed by HPLC analysis of cholesterol and individual esters. Oxidation was assessed by cholesterol ester loss and 7-ketocholesterol formation. Cell viability was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release and cell protein levels. Glycation of LDL by glycolaldehyde and methylglyoxal, but not glucose (in either the presence or absence of copper ions), resulted in cholesterol and cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophage cells, but not smooth muscle or endothelial cells. The extent of lipid accumulation depends on the degree of glycation, with increasing aldehyde concentration or incubation time, giving rise to greater extents of particle modification and lipid accumulation. Modification of lysine residues appears to be a key determinant of cellular uptake.']"
